title: "Ruby - is it worth it?"

When I first started to learn about Ruby in bootcamp, I absolutely loved it.  I had just built my first React app and was deep into JavaScript but by week eight of bootcamp, I was eager to learn something different.

Ruby seemed intuitive (at least to me) and the syntax felt a lot closer to the English language. 

"Why didn't I learn this first?" I thought, as I was making my way through Ruby modules with ease.  Well - it turns out that question is frequently asked. 

Should one start their journey into web development by learning Ruby first?
What can I build with Ruby?
Why is everyone asking if Ruby is still relevant?
