***When*** I joined the Lighthouse Labs Web Development bootcamp in October, I felt a sense of dread knowing I would be pair programming with cohort mates just three days into the program. I had very little previous coding experience, was trying to conquer the basics and was worried about being judged, or not contributing enough. I had also never seen pair programming in action before, so the thought of working remotely with strangers on a coding challenge was sending me into a bit of a spiral.

Fast forward to today. I am finishing up week nine of the bootcamp and in my experience, the situations in which Iâ€™ve learned the most have happened while pair programming remotely.

In this article I will discuss some benefits to remote pair programming as well as provide some tools to help get you started!
